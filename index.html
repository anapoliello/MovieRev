<h1>Movie Review: The Meg</h1>
<h2>Plot</h2>
<p>A giant shark is released from the bowles of the sea when a group of scientists penetrate a mist barrier to see how far down the ocean floor really is. In the process of exploration, the shuttle is attacked by an unknown entity. The entity escapes the confines of the mist barrier when a rescue crew goes in to save the shuttle, and brings back with it a ancient species of shark.</p>
<h3>Plot Review</h3>
<p>Well, it wasn't exactly <em>JAWS</em> but is also wasn't <em>Sharknado.</em></p>
